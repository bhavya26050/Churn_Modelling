Churn Modeling Project

Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a machine learning model. Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stop using a company's services during a specific time frame. Accurately predicting churn can help businesses improve customer retention strategies and optimize their operations.

Features

Dataset Used: The project leverages a structured dataset containing customer demographics, account information, and usage statistics.

Modeling Techniques: Machine learning algorithms were applied to build a robust churn prediction model.

Evaluation Metrics: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate the model.

Data Visualization: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed with visualizations to understand patterns and relationships in the data.
