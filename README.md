# 📊 Churn Modeling Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a machine learning model. Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers that stop using a company's services during a specific time frame. Accurately predicting churn helps businesses enhance customer retention strategies and optimize their operations.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📂 **Dataset Used:** Structured dataset containing customer demographics, account information, and usage statistics.
- 🤖 **Modeling Techniques:** Various machine learning algorithms applied to build a robust churn prediction model.
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance measured using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
- 📊 **Data Visualization:** Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
